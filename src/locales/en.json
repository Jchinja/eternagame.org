The “Cloud Lab” expansion also allowed for something novel - the ability for players to propose their own experiments, which was done throughout the lifetime of the Cloud Lab.

With the ability to test thousands of players’ designs for RNA switch puzzles at a time, Eterna players began to tackle some of their hardest challenges yet: building RNA computers. And this time, instead of small molecules, players would be attempting to bind oligonucleotides (oligos), small pieces of RNA or DNA. Eterna players quickly demonstrated their ability to design logic gates and ratiometric calculators using RNA binding to multiple oligos.",
  "history:science-body-15": "The testing of multi-state RNAs on the RNA Array was perfect preparation for Eterna’s first medically-relevant challenges, OpenTB, aiming to create a fast, low-cost, easily-deployable diagnostic for tuberculosis, one of the world’s largest public health crises, and OpenCRISPR, aiming to create designs which would improve the safety of the CRISPR gene editing technology by allowing it to be turned on and off on demand. IN 2017, the OpenTB project led to successful RNA calculator molecules, which Stanford will patent with Eterna players as named co-inventors. The Das Laboratory is testing these molecules in real-world diagnostic devices. And in 2018, Eterna returned to more basic research in riboswitch design, exploring designing RNA switches using new types of small molecules.",
  "history:science-body-16": "In 2019, Eterna piloted our next major project, the Ribosome Challenge: Players were challenged to stabilize the ribosome to allow for further work in ribosome engineering, including the ability to develop novel materials that are costly or impossible to produce by other methods. Because this project presented a novel challenge in designing significantly longer strands of RNA, players were given added information during the design to suggest which molecular areas were best to mutate given scientific knowledge of existing ribosomes that evolved in bacteria and how some mutations impact ribosome function, based on experimental results from the lab of collaborator Dr. Michael Jewett (Northwestern University).",

  "help:end-of-stacks-text": "The ends of stacks, where they meet loops, are the weakest points in an RNA. They usually need strong bonds to hold them together. Placing <red>G</red>-<green>C</green>s at the ends of stacks is a good strategy for starting puzzles.<newline><newline>Some puzzles will restrict the number of <red>G</red>-<green>C</green>s that you can use.

  "help:shape-guide-text": "The shape guide is the box at the top left part of the screen that shows the shape that you need to fold an RNA into.

Next, place <blue>U</blue>-<red>G</red> bonds one at a time in the middle of stacks, spacing them apart from each other.

  "help:boosting-loops-text": "Loops can be strengthened using boosts. The most common loop boost is placing a <red>G</red> at the lowest numbered base next to a stack.

  "help:1-1-loops-text": "Loops that have one loose nucleotide on each side are called 1-1 loops. They always have two stacks coming out at opposite sides. You can boost 1-1 loops by placing <red>G</red>s on the two unbonded bases. These <red>G</red>s strengthen the loop because they bond to each other. <red>G</red>s rarely bond; here, the 1-1 loop happens to hold them apart from each other at just the right distance to make this possible.\n",

A loop with energy of -1 is more likely to fold than a loop with an energy of 2.<newline><newline>Energy is a powerful tool: it lets you see how your choices help the RNA fold.<newline><newline>Remember, negative numbers are better for an RNA.

  "help:switch-puzzles-text": "Switch puzzles fold into two different shapes. Switch RNAs change shape when they capture a molecule. However, the sequence of bases doesn't change. The challenge with these puzzles is to design a sequence of bases that works for both shapes.<newline><newline>Click the toggle above the natural/target mode buttons to switch between the two shapes (this toggle only appears on switch levels). The highlighting base tool is extremely useful when solving switch puzzles.\n",
  "help:highlighting-bases-text": "Highlight specific bases by right-clicking them (command-click on a Mac). This will place a black circle around the base. This black circle stays on that base in natural mode and target mode and for both states of a switch puzzle.
